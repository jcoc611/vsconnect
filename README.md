# VSConnect

*Status: Alpha (usable)*

VSConnect `("OSS - Connect")` is the ultimate network client for VSCode. It provides a commandline-like interface where
you can submit network requests and receive network responses. It comes with basic industry-standard
Protocols such as HTTP and DNS, and it also provides several extension points so you can add extra
Protocols and UI Handlers via separate VSCode extensions.

## Contribute
Contributions, PRs and issues welcome! Some things you can do:
1. Try out the extension and share any feedback you have.
2. File issues for bugs and features you'd like to see addressed.
3. Contribute your own VSCode extensions that use the contribution points to add extra UI Handlers
or Protocols.
4. Contribute bug fixes, features, or extra Protocols to the core (this) repo. Only standard
Protocols and Components will be accepted. Proprietary or esoteric ones should be added as separate
extensions instead.
